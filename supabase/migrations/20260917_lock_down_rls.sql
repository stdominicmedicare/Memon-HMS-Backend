-- Lock down Supabase RLS for Memon HMS (apply on existing projects).
--
-- Problem: bootstrap schema created FOR ALL TO authenticated USING (true)
-- WITH CHECK (true) on every table, so any logged-in user could read/write
-- PHI via PostgREST with their session JWT, bypassing Express RBAC.
--
-- Fix: enable RLS on every public table, drop any client-facing policies,
-- keep RLS enabled with no permissive policies (deny for anon/authenticated),
-- revoke table grants from client roles. Express keeps working because it
-- uses the service_role key, which bypasses RLS.
--
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor (or psql) against the live project.
